# Zork

Wellcome to my mini and personalised experience of Zork.

The game follows a boy who needs to go to school, but he lost his key to get in and out of the house. To find the keys, you'll need to investigate the house and follow the clues that your brother, mother, and a mysterious man will give you. 

Will you be able to get out of the house? Or will you arrive late at school?

In order to know how to play my version of Zork, you need to know all the commands available in the game and how to use them.

## Experience doing this project

At first, the game was so difficult due to the lack of clues that the game itself was giving you. I thought that the experience of the player will be painful and also hard to reach through the end. Because of that, I though about implementing dialogues with specific characters in order to help the player have a better experience, don't loose track of the main path and, the most important, **FUN!**.

My thought about implementing dialogues with NPCs was a bit complex due to the texts with the requirement that I imposed myself. That one was reading from an external document and then store all the data within the code. I prefered to use JSON, because it's a format that I like to treat with data. Then I had to approach how could I use that data and make the characters reach though their specific dialogs. For that, I approached to do a controller that controls all the dialogues, depending on who NPC was speaking at the moment. In the end, I made it possible to implement this feature that it's very interesting and very useful in this game. 

What I struggled was at first about how to relate the different types of entities inside the game. However, during the process of understanding and the requirements of each class I arrived at the conclusion and get the structure that now the code has. Thanks to that, I was able to make profit of the class Entity to get to the final results I wanted.
